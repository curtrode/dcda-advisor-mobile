<span font_desc="Helvetica 12" weight="bold">What it is</span>
<span font_desc="Helvetica 10.5">A mobile-first degree planning app for Digital Culture &amp; Data Analytics (DCDA) students at TCU. It provides an interactive wizard to audit completed coursework and plan future semesters toward graduation.</span>

<span font_desc="Helvetica 12" weight="bold">Who it's for</span>
<span font_desc="Helvetica 10.5">Primary users are DCDA major or minor students at TCU planning their degree requirements.</span>

<span font_desc="Helvetica 12" weight="bold">What it does</span>
<span font_desc="Helvetica 10.5">- Guides users through History (completed courses), Planning (future scheduling), and Review phases.
- Enforces degree logic: major vs minor credit totals, core vs elective categorization, mutually exclusive courses.
- Maps transfer or special credits into general electives.
- Generates semester plans through graduation, supports optional summer terms, and schedules the capstone in the final spring.
- Presents a review dashboard with progress bars, completed lists, and a semester plan.
- Uses JSON course catalog and semester offerings data; stores user progress locally in browser storage.</span>

<span font_desc="Helvetica 12" weight="bold">How it works</span>
<span font_desc="Helvetica 10.5">- UI built from wizard steps and reusable UI components in `src/components/`.
- Data sources in `src/data/` (courses, requirements, semester offerings).
- State and requirement logic in hooks: `useStudentData` and `useRequirements`.
- Course filtering and scheduling helpers in `src/services/courses.ts`.
- Flow: user inputs -> hooks update state -> requirements engine computes unmet categories -> planning steps schedule courses -> review summarizes progress.</span>

<span font_desc="Helvetica 12" weight="bold">How to run</span>
<span font_desc="Helvetica 10.5">- Prereq: Node.js 18+.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
- Start dev server: `npm run dev`.</span>
